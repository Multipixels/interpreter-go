## Advent of Code

This repo is where I follow along to Thorsten Ball's _Writing an Interpreter in Go_ book (which can be found here: <https://interpreterbook.com/>) to create an interpreter for the Monkey programming language.

`./code_from_textbook/` contains the code repository provided by the textbook, and was only used for reference. My code and implementation of the Monkey interpreter can be found in `./monkey/`.
